### Project goal

In the paper, the authors propose the generalization of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method parametrized by deep neural networks. Following their idea, we seek to
* build a model described in the paper;
* reproduce the experiments of the authors;
* apply the proposed sampling method to the task of text generation.

Team members: Anastasiia Baiandina, Kristina Rakova.
